   - `htop` - Interactive process viewer (enhanced version of top, may need to install).
   - `kill` - Terminate a process.
   - `killall` - Kill processes by name.
   - `nice` and `renice` - Change the priority of a process.

5. **Networking:**
   - `ping` - Send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts.
   - `ifconfig` - Configure a network interface (now obsolete, use `ip` command).
   - `ip` - Show/manipulate routing, devices, policy routing, and tunnels.
   - `netstat` - Print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics (use `ss` command now).
   - `ss` - Utility to investigate sockets.

   - `du` - Estimate file space usage.

7. **System Monitoring:**
   - `free` - Display amount of free and used memory.
   - `uptime` - Tell how long the system has been running.
   - `dmesg` - Print or control the kernel ring buffer.
   - `journalctl` - Query and display messages from the journal.

### Important Protocols:

1. **HTTP/HTTPS:**
   - Used for web traffic.
   - Understand basics of RESTful services and API endpoints.
   - `curl` can be used to interact with HTTP/HTTPS endpoints.

2. **SSH (Secure Shell):**
   - Protocol for securely logging into remote systems.
   - `ssh` for logging in, `scp` for secure copying, `rsync` for synchronizing files/directories.

3. **FTP/SFTP (File Transfer Protocol/Secure File Transfer Protocol):**
   - Used for transferring files.
   - `ftp` and `sftp` commands for handling file transfers.

4. **DNS (Domain Name System):**
   - Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
   - `nslookup` and `dig` for DNS querying.

5. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):**
   - Protocol for sending emails.

6. **HTTP/2:**
   - Understand enhancements over HTTP/1.1.

### Configuration Management and Automation Tools:
While you're focusing on Linux and protocols, it's also beneficial to understand tools commonly used in DevOps:

- **Ansible:** Simple automation tool using `YAML`.
- **Puppet/Chef:** Configuration management tools.
- **Terraform:** Infrastructure as code tool.
- **Docker:** Containerization platform.
- **Kubernetes:** Container orchestration tool.
